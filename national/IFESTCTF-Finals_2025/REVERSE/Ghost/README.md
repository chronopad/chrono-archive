title: Ghost
value: 500
description: Beneath the quiet hum of a forgotten webserver, something unnatural stirred, code without conscience, breathing in silence.  
A shadow in the form of a script, stitched in obfuscation, eavesdropping like a ghost at a door.  
They called it a glitch, a bug, a ghost, but he knew better.  

***Important**: Do not run the malware outside the container unless you are absolutely sure of what you're doing.

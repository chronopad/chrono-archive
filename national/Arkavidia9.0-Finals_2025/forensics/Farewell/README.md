It's been almost a week since I last saw Chizuru. I've gone to her place several times, but no one answered the door. However, I could hear her sobbing from outside on a few occasions. All of this started after Chizuru and the team assigned to search for Darmodar arrived at Chicken Island to look for clues. I asked the team for the file that supposedly contains information related to Darmodar, but I couldn't solve the problem. Can you help me figure it out and find out why Chizuru is so sad?

description: Hey it's me Mr. Shock, I’ve got a question, totally not for me, of course. It’s for a friend. So here’s the situation, this friend just lost about 1 million USDT. Yeah... brutal. He’s kind of in panic mode right now, and I think he really needs that money back.

Now, here’s the weird part. We’re not exactly sure how it happened. But let’s just say this friend has a very special relationship with his browser. He’s got it loaded with so many Chrome extensions, it’s honestly a miracle the thing even runs. Like, there’s an extension for everything. Want to count pixels? Got it. Turn tabs into cats? Got that too. He’s basically running an entire app store in his toolbar.

I’m guessing one of those extensions was malicious. Probably some sneaky malware just chilling in the background, waiting for a chance to strike. I’ve attached one of the extensions he remembers installing before the whole thing went down. Would really appreciate it if you could take a look.

Also... just between us... let’s pretend this friend isn’t terrible at cybersecurity and definitely didn’t ignore all the red flags, alright?

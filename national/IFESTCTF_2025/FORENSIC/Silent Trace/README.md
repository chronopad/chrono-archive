description: A few days before he disappeared, a UI designer sent a project drawing to the security team, accompanied by a strange note: “Three cards appear in my dreams, The Magician, The Moon, and The Hermit. The letters dance, but only if you know which string to pull.” The drawing holds several clues. Some seem ordinary, but one of them records a trail that leads to a deeper communication, as if there is a hidden story behind it.

The trail leads you to a hidden message. Not a sound, not an image, just a small movement captured by an old device. Can you follow the movement to the end?

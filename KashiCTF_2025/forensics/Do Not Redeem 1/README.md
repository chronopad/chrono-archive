title: Do Not Redeem #1
value: 350
description: Uh oh, we're in trouble again. Kitler's Amazon Pay wallet got emptied by some scammer. Can you figure out the OTP sent to kitler right before that happened, as well as the time (unix timestamp in milliseconds) at which kitler received that OTP?

Flag format: `KashiCTF{OTP_TIMESTAMP}`, i.e. `KashiCTF{XXXXXX_XXXXXXXXXXXXX}`

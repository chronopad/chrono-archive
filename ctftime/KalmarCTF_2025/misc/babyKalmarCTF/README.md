description: Ever played a CTF inside a CTF?

We were looking for a new scoring algorithm which would both reward top teams for solving super hard challenges, but also ensure that the easiest challenges wouldn't go to minimum straight away if more people played than we expected. 

Thats when we came across this ingenious suggestion! https://github.com/sigpwny/ctfd-dynamic-challenges-mod/issues/1

We've implemented it this scoring idea(see here: https://github.com/blatchley/ctfd-dynamic-challenges-mod ) and spun up a small test ctf to test it out. 

If you manage to win babykalmarCTF, we'll even give you a flag at /flag!

Spin up your own personal babykalmarCTF here: https://lab1.kalmarc.tf/

**Note:**
Rather than each member starting their own,  we encourage one person to make a remote for your team, and then share the link with everyone else!
Please be nice to instances, getting flag doesn't involve heavy compute/"hacking CTFd" or abuse on remote.  
Its solveable through very normal interactions with a CTFd instance.
We encourage the whole team working together on the same remote.

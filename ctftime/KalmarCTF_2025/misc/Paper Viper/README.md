description: There's been a snake escape at the Toronto zoo recently, which was by all accounts, a rather embarrassing affair. Snakes, as it turns out, are distressingly good at ignoring human notions of "inside" and "outside". As a measure to keep their own snakes well-contained, the zookeepers here at the Copenhagen zoo have taken to deploying a state-of-the-art absolutely impenetrable cage. At least, that's what the advertising brochure said.

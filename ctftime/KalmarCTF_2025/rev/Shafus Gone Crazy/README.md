title: Shafus Gone Crazy
value: 1000
description: You thought you knew SHA-256? Think again. Somewhere in the depths of obfuscation madness, Shafus the Algorithmic Trickster decided to "improve" the standard hash function with a mix of bizarre mathematical operations, unexpected transformations, and a sprinkle of chaos.

Your task is to reverse engineer Shafus' deranged creation, understand its quirks, and break through the cryptographic maze to uncover the hidden flag.

Can you untangle the madness, or will you be left questioning reality itself?

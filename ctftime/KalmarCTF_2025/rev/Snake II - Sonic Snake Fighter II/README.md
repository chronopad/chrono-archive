value: 1000
description: The stakes have been raised! This time, the snake game isn't just about apples—there's a whole new dimension to explore. Hidden within the depths of this SNES game lies a secret, waiting to be uncovered by those skilled enough to decode its mechanics.

Some say there’s more happening behind the scenes than meets the eye. Only those who truly understand the inner workings of the system will uncover the flag.

*Note: This challenge is not about snakes and apples, you don't need to spend your time on reading 65816 disassembly, it really **sounds** like the flag got hadouken'd to another castle*

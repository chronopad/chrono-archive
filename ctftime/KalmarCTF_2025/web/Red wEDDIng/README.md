description: There is this AI named `xbow` and they claim that it matches the capabilities of a top human pentester. But we do wonder why it only goes for the low hanging fruit in random github projects so they can harvest as many CVEs as possible. After reading https://xbow.com/blog/xbow-eddi-path/ you'll notice they gave up easily when testing for higher severity vulnerabilities.

Completely unrelated, i spun up https://github.com/labsai/EDDI with all their findings patched. I hope no one gets Arbitrary Code Execution on my server ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

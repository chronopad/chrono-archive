title: Old Diner
value: 425
description: My friend once visited this place that served ice cream with coke. He said he had the best Greek omlette of his life and called it a very american experience.
Can you find the name of the diner and the amount he paid?

Flag Format: `KashiCTF{Name_of_Diner_Amount}`

**For clarification on the flag format**
The diner's name is in title case with spaces replaced by underscores. The amount is without currency sign, and in decimal, correct to two decimal places, i.e. `KashiCTF{Full_Diner_Name_XX.XX}`
